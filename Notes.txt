Repository and Unit of Work Patterns

The repository pattern reduces the duplicate query logic. 

When using DbSet & DbContext directly in your appication, it becomes directly connected to Entity Framework. 
And when you want to update your ORM, you will need to modify your applicationcode directly.
However if all of this is behind a Repository and your application code relies upon a Repository to return the right data, it will be independent of ORM.

But if you are creating a basic application or where requirements are changing frequently, this pattern may be not useful. EFC could be your best choice.
